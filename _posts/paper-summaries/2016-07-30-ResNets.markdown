## Summary

Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) is the current state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The key difference between ResNets and
other popular architectures is the use of "shortcut-connections". Basically, it was determined that "very deep" neural networks, or DNNs with a large number of stacked layers, 
were exhibiting a degradation in accuracy not caused by overfitting. Residual Layers in a DNN attempt to learn a "residual" mapping, which is the desired hidden mapping minus the input to the residual layer.
The input to the layer is then "added" back in later; hence the name "shortcut-connection". One of the motivations for doing this is that it is easy
for the network to learn to send the residual to 0 (and hence learn an identity mapping), which is useful if an identity mapping is optimal for the situation. Learning an 
identity mapping is very difficult for a stack of nonlinear layers. These residual layers do not add any extra parameters. 

## Evidence

The authors tested ResNets on ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and won first place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. 

## Strengths

The idea is simple and effective. The material is presented clearly with lots of data to back it up.
