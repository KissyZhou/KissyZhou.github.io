## Assertions con't

Think of `A` as the set of states where assertion `A` is true

* $ A \supset B$ means `A` is a subset of `B`
* `A and B` is the intersection of A and B
* `A or B` is the union of A and B

## While loop

After the loop, we know that `not B` must be the case. We have: 

```
while B do S = 
if B then {S; while B do S} else skip
```
Doesn't tell us that the loop terminates!

This becomes
```
{P}
if B then {S; while B do S} else skip
{~B and Q}
```

Using rule for if-statement, this is

```
{P and B} S; while B do S {~B and Q}, P and ~B $\supset$ ~B and Q
---
{P} while B do S {~B and Q}
```

Loop invariants -> true before and after executing loops. Solution to a fixed point equation.

For assignment and if-statements, given a postcondition, we can always calculate the weakest precondition by starting with the postcondition and applying axioms (?). Can't do this with loop invariants.

## Termination

**Partial correctness**: nontermination allowed. **Total correctness**: termination required. Old-fashioned perspective.

**Well founded set**: A set with a partial order is well founded if there are no infinitely decreasing sequences of distinct elements from the set. E.g., the Natural Numbers (no negatives).

To prove a loop terminates, define a *variant function* which takes values from a well founded set. Show that each loop iteration decreases the value of the variant function or establishes ~B. Since the variant function can't decrease forever, the loop must terminate.
