## Associativity and Precedence

* Productions that are left-recursive force evaluation in left-to-right order (left associativity)
* Productions that are right-recursive for evaluation in right-to-left order (right associativity)
* Precedence is introduced by adding new non-terminal symbols. Cascade symbols with lowest precedence closest to the start symbol.

Example: 

* Precedence: (), - (unary), $\uparrow$, *, /, +-
* Associativity: left: */+-, right: $\uparrow$

```
expr ::= term | expr + term | expr - term
term ::= factor | term * factor | term / factor
factor ::= primary $\uparrow$ factor | primary
primary ::= - primary | element
element ::= x | y | z | ( expr )
```

## Syntax Errors in Recursive Descent Parsing

Read Scott section 2.3.5 (in the online supplement) through Exception based errors. 
There are several approaches:

* Halting - when an error is detected, just stop and print message
* Syntax error recovery
    * Panic mode recovery
    * Phrase level recovery
    * Context specific
    * Exception based

We will use exception based error handling for our project. This seems to be the most common approach.
