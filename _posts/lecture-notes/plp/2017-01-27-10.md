## Dynamic Scope

Recall, scope is determined at runtime and depends on flow of execution.

## Disadvantages

* Breaks encapsulation
* Can't statically check type references to non locals
* More difficult to understand, requires knowing the calling sequence
* Access to non-locals is slower in dynamically scoped languages

Note - Lisp became Scheme and transitioned from dynamic to static scoping! Most modern languages are statically scoped. 

## Implementing static scope in a compiler

* Use a data structure called a *symbol table* that contains (name, attribute) pairs
* Flat block structure-organize table by name, scope (local, global), and attributes
    * Add/remove entries in table as they leave and enter local scope
* A stack is a natural data structure for handling nested blocks (many scope levels)
	* Fast add and removal, but slow look-up. This is backwards from what we want!
* Use Leblanc-Cook symbol table (hash table)
    * Each scope is assigned a unique serial number
    * A separate scope stack records the scopes that belong to the current referencing environment
