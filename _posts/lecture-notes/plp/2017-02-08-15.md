## Classification of types

* Built-in types have direct hardware support
* Interesting examples: 
    * complex numbers (pair of numbers) 
    * fixed point - contains an implicit decimal point at programmer specified location (e.g., dollars and cents)

### Numeric types

Have to decide on certain properties when designing a language, such as:

* length of the numeric type, i.e., number of bytes
* complex types - are these built in, standard library, unsupported?
* rational numbers? - pair of integers
* integers with arbitrary precision? 

## Common terms

**discrete types** (ordinal) are countable and have a well-defined notion of predecessor and successor (except first and last). These are "ordered". **scalar types** are types such as discrete, real, rational, and complex.

Enumerations were first introduced in Pascal. Helped with readability and getting rid of some weird bugs. May be represented internally as integers, but not always compatible with integers (e.g., can't set `int x;` to an enum in most languages). In C, enums aren't type safe since they really are just a `typedef` for an `int`. 

In OO languages, there is difficulty mixing enums with inheritance. In Java, enums are a class. 

## Subrange types

Values are contiguous subset of value of a discrete base type.

```Pascal
type test_score = 0..100.
type weekday = (sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat).
type workday = (mon..fri).
```

`weekday` is just an enum in Pascal. `test_score` is compatible with integers, since it's built on integers. 

## Composite types

* nonscalar types
* Created by applying type constructor to one or more simple types

These include arrays, lists, files, etc.

## Type checking

Enforcing the rules of a type system

### Type equivalence

How to define equivalence? Based on structural, name, etc.?

*structural equivalence* says two types are equivalent if they consist of the same components put together in the same way. This is problematic! *name equivalence* is based on lexical occurence. Most modern imperative languages use this. 

With `aliases` such as `typedef`, have to decide between *loose* and *strict* name equivalence. For *loose*, aliases are equivalent in an otherwise name equivalent language. In *strict*, aliased types are not equivalent. 

## Type casting

Useful when: 

* Types are structurally equivalent but language is name equivalent
* Types have different sets of values, but intersection is represented in the same way (e.g., subtype of integers and integers)
* Types have different low-level representations, but there is some sensible correspondence between them (e.g., short and int)

Compiler generates run-time code for checking that the cast is valid. 

*Non-converting type cast* does not alter underlying bits, merely reinterpreting them. Breaks the language's type system! In C++, see `reinterpret_cast<T>()`.
