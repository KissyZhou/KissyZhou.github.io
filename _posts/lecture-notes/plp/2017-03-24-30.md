# Denotational Semantics

Slonneger & Kurtz 9.1 - 9.3, 9.4

## Semantics

* semantic domain - some notation for talking about meaning
* semantic meaning - maps syntatic elements to the semantic domain

In **denotational semantics** the syntatic domain is the elements of the abstract syntax of a language. The semantic domain consists of abstract mathematical objects (integers, booleans, lists, functions, etc). Semantic functions map elements of syntatic domain to semantic domain.
