## Implementing dynamic scope

* Association List - uses a stack at runtime. Linear search to find bindings.
* Hash table - fast lookup but scope entry and exit are more complex

## Binding of referencing environment

What if we create a reference to a subroutine? 
* The one active when reference was created? AKA deep binding
* The one active when subroutine is invoked? AKA shallow binding

Most languages with static scoping use deep binding. 

## Definitions

A **closure** is a reference to a subroutine together with a representation of the binding environment. This is necessary with deep binding. With an association list, a closure can be represented by a pointer to the location in the stack. 

A **first class object** can be passed as a parameter, returned, and assigned to a variable (e.g., simple types, functions in functional languages). A **second class object** can be  passed but not returned or assigned. **Third class objects** can't be passed, returned, or assigned.

See Scott pg. 156 for the Scheme example on why the desire to maintain stack based allocation is the reason that most imperative languages do not have *first class subroutines*.
