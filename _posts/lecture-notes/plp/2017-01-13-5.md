## Top-Down Parsing

Possible to fail if you replace the start symbol with the wrong production. We need to **predict** which production to choose, preferably by looking only at one symbol. 

An LL(k) grammar can be parsed by a top-down parser with a max k-token lookahead. 

An LL(*) grammar can be parsed by a top-down parser with unbounded lookahead. 

LL(1) is best. 

## FIRST sets

* FIRST($\alpha$) is the set of tokens (or $\epsilon$) that appear as the first symbol in some string generated from $\alpha$

* FIRST($\alpha$) $\equiv$ {c : $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$* c $\beta$ }, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary strings of symbols while c is a terminal

## FIRST sets and LL(1)

To predict the production to use, we need to satisfy: 
*The FIRST set of all productions with the same left hand sides are disjoint*

## FOLLOW sets

FOLLOW(A) is the set of all terminal symbols that can immediately follow a subsequence derived from A in a sequence derived from the start symbol, S.

FOLLOW(A) $\equiv$ {c : S $\rightarrow^{+}$ $\alpha$ A c $\beta$ }

## FIRST and FOLLOW sets and LL(1)

Additional condition: for all non-terminals A: if A $\rightarrow$* $\epsilon$, then FIRST(A) $\cap$ FOLLOW(A) = {}

## Predict sets

### LL(1) rule

**The predict sets of all producions with the same left side are disjoint**

Necessary and sufficient for a grammar to be LL(1).

We use predict sets to determine whether a grammar is LL(1), so that we can use a top-down parser on that grammar.
