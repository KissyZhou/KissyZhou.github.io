Chapter 15, 17.1 and 17.2 from Scott

## Compilation

Intermediate code generation motivated by the fact that code improvements can be done more easily on non-hierarchical structures such as AST. Nodes are grouped into *basic blocks*, and then a control flow graph is created.

A *basic block* is a maximal length set of instructions that should execute sequentially at runtime. No branches in or out; starts as the target of a jump and ends with a jump. Operations are instructions for idealized machine with infinite virtual registers.

## Machine Independent Code Improvement

These are transformations on the control flow graph.

* Local code improvements removes redundancy within a block
* Global code improvements identifies and removes a variety of redundancies between blocks within a subroutine. E.g., within a loop, an expression that is computed only once need not be recomputed again 

## Target code generation

String together basic blocks into a linear sequence. Then, blocks must be translated into the instruction set of the machine. 

## Machine specific code improvement

* Register allocation- map the unlimited virtual registers onto the bounded set of registers available in the target machine. May need additional loads/stores to multiplex 1 real register for 2 virtual registers
* Instruction scheduling- pipelining
* Code improvement
