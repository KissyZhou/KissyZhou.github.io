Axioms and inference rules allow us to prove that a triple is valid. The axioms and inference rules implicitly define the meaning of a program. 

## Assignment axiom

```
{ Q { V := E } and E is defined }
V := E
{ Q }
```
Whatever is true about E beforehand, is true about V afterwards.

## Notation and vocab

$A \supset B$ (`A` implies `B` everywhere) means that any assignment of values to the variables that make `A` true will also make `B` true. We say that `A` is stronger than `B`, and `B` is weaker than `A`. 

Example: $x > 0 \supset x \geq 0$.

P is stronger than `true`, because any assignment of variables makes `true` true!

## Inference rules

Strengthen the pre-condition, or weaken the post-condition to relate statements about truth

## Sequence rule

Transitivity

## Logic variables

Relate the pre- and post-conditions with "logic variables", e.g., `X` and `Y` can have an arbitrary value, but it does not change. 

```
{ x = X and y = Y }
temp := x; 
x := y;
{ x = Y and temp = X }
y := temp; 
{ x = Y and y = X }
```
