## Let expressions

```
let val x = expr_1 in expr_2 end;
```

The value of the entire `let` expression is the value of `expr_2`. `x` is a new variable that is binded to the result of `expr_1`. The binding is local to the let expr.

Example:

```
fun rev x = let val(a,b) = rev2(x, []) in b end;
```
which is a `val rev = fn : 'a list -> 'a list`. The result is accumulated in `b` and returned in `x`. 

## Logical conditionals in ML

* `orelse` is `or`
* `andalso` is `and`

Strange!

## Infix operators

Can have any precedence in 0 to 9. Can be left associative, or right-associative if `infixr` is used.

Example: 

Function to indicate if item is in a list,

```
infix mem;
fun(x mem []) = false
  | (x mem (y::ys)) = x=y orelse (x mem ys);
```

Note that `mem` only works with types that have an equality test defined. Denoted as `''a`. This is called *constrained polymorphism*, since not any old type can be used! Built into the language.

## Custom data types

keyword `datatype`. Use pattern-matching to indicate valid constructors. 

Example:
```
datatype Person = Queen 
  | Peer of string * string * int
  | Peasent of string
  | Knight of string
  | ...
```

Functions over a user defined type can be defined using patterns over constructors. Note that concatenating strings is done with the `^` character, e.g., `"Sir" ^ name`. 

```
fun title Queen = "Her majesty the Queen"
    | title (Peer (deg, terr,_)) = "The " ^ deg ^ " of " ^ terr
    ...
```
This is `var title = fn: person -> string`.

Datatypes are the `disjoint union` of their constructors- labeled disjoint types. They are polymorphic as well.

Example: 

```
datatype ('a, 'b) union = ln1 of 'a | ln2 of 'b;
val v1 = [ln1 "hello", ln1 "bye", ln2 3, ln1 "adios"];
```
This is `val v1 = [...] : (string, int) union list`. Type inference~

Example:

```
datatype bin_tree = leaf of int
  | node of bin_tree * bin_tree;
```

Simple tree: `node(leaf 1, node(leaf 2, leaf 3));`

## Binding functions with Let

Let expressions can also locally bind functions to names. Useful for helper functions.

```
fun ordered (leaf n) = true
    | ordered (node(t1, t2)) = (max t1 <= min t2)
                               andalso (ordered t1)
                               andalso (ordered t2);
```
This is a `val ordered = fn: bin_tree -> bool`. Note that `max` and `min` are also helper functions. Can define `max` and `min` within `ordered` using `let`. 

What if we wanted to express binary trees as `(5, (3, 2))`? Need to write a scanner and a parser for this grammar! Can do this in ML. 

## Case expressions

```
case E of P1 => E1 | ... | Pn => En
```

The value of E is matched against patterns P1, ..., Pn. The value of the expression corresponding to the first pattern to match the value of E is the value of the expression.

Assume you have a list of scanned tokens from some inputs, `ts`. Recall, a binary tree should be `(binTree, binTree)`. 

```
fun binTree ts = 
    case ts of 
        (numlit x)::tr => tr
        | lparen::tr => 
            let val ts1 = binTree tr
            let val ts2 = case ts1 of 
                          comma::tr2 => tr2
                          | _ => raise parseError
            let val ts3 = binTree ts2
            val ts4 = case ts3 of 
                      rparen::tr4 => tr4
                      | _ => raise parseError
            in ts4 (* return remainder of the list of tokens *)
            end
        | _ => raise parseError
```

Putting function `binTree` together with our scanner `scan`,

```
fun parse s = 
    let val result = binTree (scan s)
    in result = []
    end;
```

which, if `result` is non-empty, means the parsing failed so the value returned is false.
