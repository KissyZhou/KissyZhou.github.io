## Let expressions

```
let val x = expr_1 in expre_2 end;
```

The value of the entire `let` expression is th value of `expr_2`. `x` is a new variable that is binded to the result of `expr_1`. 

Example:

```
fun rev x = let val(a,b) = rev2(x, []) in b end;
```
which is a `val rev = fn : 'a list -> 'a list`. The result is accumulated in `b` and returned in `x`. 

## Logical conditionals in ML

* `orelse` is `or`
* `andalso` is `and`

Strange!

## Infix operators

Can have any precedence in 0 to 9. Can be left associative, or right-associative if `infixr` is used.

Example: 

```
infix mem;
fun(x mem []) = false
  | (x mem (y::ys)) = x=y orelse (x mem ys);
```

Note that `mem` only works with types that have an equality test defined. Denoted as `''a`. 

## Custom data types

keyword `datatype`. Use pattern-matching to indicate valid constructors. 

Example:
```
datatype Person = Queen 
  | Peasent of string
  | Knight of string
  | ...
```

Functions over a user defined type can be defined using patterns over constructors. Note that concatenating strings is done with the `^` character, e.g., `"Sir" ^ name`. 

Datatypes are the `disjoint union` of their constructors- labeled disjoint types. They are polymorphic as well.

Example2: 
```
datatype bin_tree = 
  leaf of int
  | node of bin_tree * bin_tree;
```

Simple tree: `node(leaf 1, node(leaf 2, leaf 3));`

## Binding functions with Let

Let expressions can also locally bind functions to names. Useful for helper functions.

What if we wanted to express binary trees as `(5, (3, 2))`? Need to write a scanner and a parser for this grammar! Can do this in ML.
