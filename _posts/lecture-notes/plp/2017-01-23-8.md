# Names, Scopes, and Bindings Oh My!

## Vocabulary

Need to understand definitions of name, scope, and binding in this context. 

## Object lifetime and storage management

*Distinguish between names and objects to which they refer*

### Lifetime and Scope

* Lifetime of a binding is the period of time from creation to destruction
* <span style="color:red">garbage</span> is what you get if an object outlives its binding
* <span style="color:red">dangling reference</span> is what you get if a binding outlives its object
* The scope of a binding is the region of the program in which the binding is active

### Storage allocation

* **static**: an object is given an address that is maintained throughout program execution
* **stack**: memory for objs allocated in last-in, first-out order, with subroutine calls and returns
* **heap**: blocks can be allocated and deallocated at arbitrary times

Typically use stack allocation for local variables, parameters of procedures, temporaries. Benefits are ability to reuse space, allows for recursive routines

### Stack allocation

Typical, uses stack and frame pointers.

### Heap-based allocation

Chunk of memory that OS has to allocate and deallocate. Have to deal with internal and external fragmentation (OS topic! Remember this? (Kind of...)) If you allocate big chunks of memory, when you deallocate you don't fragment so much, but then you have internal fragmentation (wasted memory).

### Deallocation

When not explicit, there is garbage collection and exiting scope (implicit ways to deallocate)

Explicit deallocation has simpler compiler implementation and better execution speed. But subject to dangling references and memory leaks due to programmer error. 

Implicit deallocation simplifies the programming task. No dangling references with garbage collection. Fewer memory leaks but may still occur if the programmer keeps references to unneeded objects. Garbage collection is getting better. 

## Scope

The scope of a binding is the part of the program (textually) in which the binding is active. More precisely, a program section of maximal size in which no bindings change (or at least in which no re-declarations are permitted)

* <span style="color:red">elaboration</span> is the process by which declarations become active (when control enters a scope)
* <span style="color:red">referencing environment</span> is the set of active bindings (at a given point in the programs execution) determined by static and/or dynamic scope rules
* <span style="color:red">binding rules</span> - when a reference to a subroutine S is stored, passed as a parameter, etc. These determine which referencing environment used when S is executed.

### Static vs. Dynamic scoping

* Statically scoped (lexically scoped) - scope determined by lexical structure. All bindings for identifiers can be resolved by examining the program. Typically choose the most recent active binding made at compile time. Used by most compiled languages.
* Dynamically scoped - scope determined at runtime and depends on flow of execution
* Global and local variabes are examples of static scopes
