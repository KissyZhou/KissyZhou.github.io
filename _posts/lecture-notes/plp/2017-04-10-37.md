## Implementation of exception handling

* Stack of handlers; maintain a stack of exception handlers - when you enter a block of code, push the corresponding handler onto the stack
* Table that contains addresses of start/end of blocks of code, along with the exception that corresponds to the code in that block. Use binary search when an exception is thrown to find the corresponding exception in the table.

In `ML`, exceptions are datatypes that are treated specially. In `Eiffel`, using the design by contract framework, routines called with appropriate preconditions should either fulfill contract or raise exception. Invariants should be restored before exception is propagated.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Ch 10 in Scott.

An **Abstract Data Type** is one that is defined in terms of the operations that it supports rather than in terms of its structure or implementation

Oberon, Niklaus Wirth's successor to Modula 2, offered type extensions. Add extra fields to a user-defined type; pure form of extensibility.

## 3 Keys for Success in OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Dynamic method binding

## Implementation of virtual functions in C++

* Each class has dispatch table (vtable)
* Each object has pointer to its class's vtable
* Objects of a subclass have a different dispatch table

The compiler knows the offset of virtual methods in the vtable, so order in the table is important. The *fragile base class* problem: to invoke a method on an object, must get address of object's vtable, calculate offset into vtable (can be done at compile time), invoke method at that address. If the base class's methods are re-ordered, clients will have to be recompiled too!

## Inheritance

Many languages don't support multiple inheritance. Complicated to implement.

## Mix-in inheritance

Single inheritance from 1 real base class, but can extend many abstract classes.
