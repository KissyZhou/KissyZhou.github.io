## Abstraction

When implementing a programmingn languange, need to decide tasks for calling subroutines. Should the caller, or callee handle it? If the subroutine does as much as possible, space is saved. Time may be saved by putting stuff in the caller instead, where more information may be known. 

For `inline` keyword, functions that are inlined must be "plopped" into code in a *semantically neutral* way. In other words, the program meaning shouldn't change by inlining. 

## Parameter passing

Pass by value is related to applicative order in the lambda calculus.
Pass by name is like normal order reduction in the lambda calculus. 
Pass by reference is an alias for the corresponding actual parameter.
