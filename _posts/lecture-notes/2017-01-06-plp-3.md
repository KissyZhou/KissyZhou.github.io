# Lexical Analysis

### Restrictions on Regular Expressions

Cannot contain recursive definitions, which limits the expressiveness of the language. An example is the fact that you can't nest comments in C or Java, e.g., /* ... /* ... */ ... */ is illegal

### Recognizing Tokens

REs specify tokens. The lexical analysis part of compilation is the utilization of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to recognize the language that can be generated by a RE alphabet. 

DFA := Finite State Machine 

Scanners are reponsible for tokenizing the source, as well as removing comments and handling pragmas, etc. 

Whitespace is handled naturally - if encountered when scanning a token, stop scanning. May need to recognize delimiters. 

### Java Implementation details of a Scanner

* Scanner class
* Enums for token types 

**Pragmas** are comments that may contain information useful to the compiler or other tools. E.g., hinting about potential for vectorization

### Closing remarks

Reserved words and keywords are distinguised by same REs as indentifiers. Specific to language. Keywords are reserved words but actually have some function. Store them in a hash map for fast lookup checking.
