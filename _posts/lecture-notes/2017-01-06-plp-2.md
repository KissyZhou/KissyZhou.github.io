## Compilation Overview

1. Character stream -> Scanner (lexical analysis) ->
2. Token stream -> Parser (syntax analysis) ->
3. Parse tree -> Semantic analysis and intermediate code generation ->
4. Abstract syntax tree or other intermediate form -> Machine-independent code improvement (optional) ->
5. Modified intermediate form -> Target code generation ->
6. Target language (e.g., assembler) -> Machine-specific code improvement (optional) ->
7. Modified target language 

1-3 represent the front-end and 4-7 represent the back-end. Java byte-code is an "intermediate form" from 4. You can mix and match different front-ends and back-ends. Creates a symbol table to map addresses/other info for variables.

### Interpretation Overview

1. Character stream -> Scanner (lexical analysis) ->
2. Token stream -> Parser (syntax analysis) ->
3. Parse tree -> Semantic analysis and intermediate code generation ->
4. Abstract syntax tree or other intermediate form -> Tree-walk routines
5. Program input -> Program output (at run-time)  

## Lexical Analysis 

Reference: Scott, CH 2 sections 2.1.1 and 2.2, need to skim 2.2.3

Lexers and scanners are synonymous. Note that **syntax** describes the structure of a language, while **semantics** describes the "meaning". 

### Regular Expressions

Gives us a formal notation for lexical structure. 

#### Formal definition of RE

A minimal RE definition is: 

1. An **atom**, which is an element of a finite alphabet $\Sigma$
2. $\epsilon$ which denotes the set containing the empty string
3. **Concatentation** denotes the set containing a string from the first RE concatenated with a string from the second RE
4. **Alternative**, represented by '\|', which denotes the union of two sets 
5. **Kleene closure**, which is a regular expression followed by a Kleene star * meaning the set of strings obtained by concatenation of zero or more strings from the set denoted by the regular expression *in front of the star*
6. **Positive closure** is a RE followed by + which means the concatenation of one or more strings generated by the regular expression in front of the star 
7. Not(A) is $\Sigma$\A

## Examples: Specifying tokens of a programming language

Can name regular expressions and use them in other regular expressions as if they were symbols. 

* \<op/> ::= + \| == \| *
* \<digit\> ::= 0 \| \<nonzero digit\>
* \<nonzero digit\> ::= 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5 \| 6 \| 7 \| 8 \| 9
* Identifiers
    * \<identifier\> ::= \<identifier start\> \<identifier part\>*
    * \<identifier start> ::= A .. Z \| a .. z \| $ 
    * \<identifier part\> ::= \<identifier start> \| \<digit\>
* \<numeric literal/> ::= \<nonzero digit\> \<digit/> * \| 0
* \<token/> ::= \<identifier/> \| \<numeric literal\> \| \<op/>
* \<comment\> ::= //(Not(Eol))*Eol
