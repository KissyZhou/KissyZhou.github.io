A 30 minute [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dkRsTqdDA) on how to write a <b>great</b> research paper 

## What I Learned ##
*  Once you have an idea, start writing right away
*  Identify what your contributions will be at the beginning of the writing process. This list can be updated as you go
*  Be engaging and grab the reader in
*  Save related works for the end
*  Use plenty of examples as evidence
*  The majority of the paper should be the details (results/analysis)
*  A reviewer should come away knowing exactly what the 1 main idea/contribution was
*  Give credit instead of tearing down other similar works and identify your weaknesses in the paper
*  Always listen carefully to criticisms
*  Have 1-2 people read each draft of your paper, being sure to have them tell you where they got lost	


<b>As a researcher, either you won't understand something and you will feel stupid and like a worm, or you will understand something and think it's too trivial and hence still feel like a worm; it turns out that the life of a PhD student is quite depressing.</b>
