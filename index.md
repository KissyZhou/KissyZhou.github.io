I'm a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Florida under [Sanjay Ranka](https://sites.google.com/site/sanjayranka/) in UF's [Transportation Institute](http://www.transportation.institute.ufl.edu/). My interests lie broadly within machine learning. Currently, I am conducting research on sensor fusion, stochastic optimization, and stochastic control for intelligent traffic intersection management.
